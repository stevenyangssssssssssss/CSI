This PO accounts for hours to be worked by the contractor under the title of Data Scientist 4. Summary of work to be performed by contractor: We are rehiring an intern as a contractor to continue the work that he started as an intern. The research is on identifying strategies to automatically adjust batch size during training to allow for largest possible batch size without restricting convergence. At the same time, the research also studies how to automatically adjust the learning rate schedule to allow for best convergence behavior. The impact of this research is at follows: 1) Better scalability on a large number of GPUs. Ability to support large batch size directly corelates with scalability 2) Fewer tuning runs to achieve good convergence. Automatic lr scheduler means the data scientist does not have to go through hit and trial to find out the ideal learning rate schedule"
